                    At Appian, I worked in the Chief Technology Office Team, developing plug-ins to extend the features of the Appian Process Automation
                    platform. Among these included integrations with Pinecone, Veeva, and a standout: a connector to Apache Kafka, enabling users to
                    directly consume and initiate Appian processes from Kafka messages. In addition to these connectors, I worked with a team of engineers to
                    develop a Javascript-based editable grid component, facilitating Excel-like functionality with Appian data. Outside of
                    engineering, I also led the product management of new technical connectors to Appian, namely xAI, SAP, and Palantir.

                <p class="description">
                    At Zillow, I worked in the Observability Team to develop a proof-of-concept for an observability framework that enables developers to define and
                    monitor their applications' service level objectives, or SLOs. To accomplish this, I developed a command-line interface tool integrated in different services
                    pipelines as well as a Grafana dashboard to visualize the SLOs in real-time.Throughout this internship, I developed my understanding of the observability and DevOps
                    fields while exploring technologies such as Golang, GitLab CI/CD, Prometheus, Grafana, and YAML. It was a really cool experience, and I visited Seattle for the 
                    first time!

                <p class="description">
                    At Prudential, I was involved in modernizing a legacy Group Insurance application that enabled users to apply for and calculate
                    their Disability Insurance. The beginning of the internship focused on making UI enhancements with Angular, while the later part
                    involved redesigning the backend of the application to support a microservice architecture. This position was my first exposure to
                    development at an enterprise-level, giving me better insight into technologies like Spring Boot, Oracle DB, Gradle, and Jenkins.

                        As a Teaching Assistant for my university's Computer Systems class, I was responsible for holding office hours, creating rubrics,
                        and grading assignments ranging from projects to exams. This experience was very rewarding, strengthening my ability to explain
                        technical concepts to others and think about approaches to solving problems. I also enjoyed teaching the material of the course,
                        which focuses on C programming, dynamic memory allocation, and process control.

                        Joining Hack4Impact gave me perspective into the world of software consulting, more specifically designing software for non-profits.
                        The team I worked on followed a traditional agile workflow, where biweekly sprints were set up and tasks were assigned for each sprint.
                        My team in particular was creating an application for Team River Runner, a nonprofit providing facilities for veterans. My work involved
                        adding a reporting feature to the application by leveraging tools like React and C#.
