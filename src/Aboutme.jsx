            <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p class="aboutmedetails"> 
                I'm a recent graduate at the <b>University of Maryland</b>, where I studied Computer Science. I'm an incoming <b>Software Engineer at Uber</b>,
                and have previous engineering experience at <b>Appian</b>, <b>Zillow</b>, and <b>Prudential Financial</b>.
                I love the creativity that comes with Computer Science,
                especially being able to work on exciting projects and collaborating with others to do so. My technical interests are pretty vast, but I'm
                particulary intrigued by DevOps, observability, and data science. Outside of my tech interests, my main hobbies include
                running, drawing, and watching/analyzing movies.
